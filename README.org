#+title: zprint.el

[[https://github.com/kkinnear/zprint][zprint]] is a library and command line tool providing a variety of pretty printing capabilities for both Clojure code and Clojure/EDN structures.
zprint.el use zprint binary to reformat Clojure code buffer very efficiently.

* Why another implementation
There is an available implementation called [[https://github.com/pesterhazy/zprint-mode.el][zprint-mode.el]] . Differences in this implementation:
- Always reformat the whole buffer, doesn't support region-based reformat.
- Don't create temp file in procedure.
- No binary download management, doesn't limit to a specified version.
- No Python needed.
- Simpler implementation.

* Usage
** manually format via shortcut
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (define-key clojure-mode-map (kbd "C-c p") 'zprint)
#+end_src

** automatically format before save buffer
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'zprint-mode)
#+end_src
