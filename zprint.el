;;; Commentary:

;; Format Clojure buffer with zprint(binary).
;; How to use:
;; 1. Manually format via shortcut:
;;
;;     (define-key clojure-mode-map (kbd "C-c p") 'zprint)
;;
;; 2. Automatically format before save:
;;
;;     (add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'zprint-mode)
;;
;;; Code:

(defvar zprint-bin-path "zprint"
  "The path to zprint binary.")

(defvar zprint-lighter " zp"
  "The lighter displayed in modeline.")

(defun zprint ()
  "Reformat code using zprint."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((contents (buffer-string))
         (orig-buf (current-buffer))
         (ln (line-number-at-pos (point) t))
         (col (- (point) (line-beginning-position)))
         (formatted-contents
          (with-temp-buffer
            (insert contents)
            (let ((buf (current-buffer))
                  (retcode (call-process-region
                            (point-min)
                            (point-max)
                            zprint-bin-path
                            t
                            (current-buffer)
                            nil)))
              (if (zerop retcode)
                  (with-current-buffer orig-buf
                    (replace-buffer-contents buf))
                (error "zprint failed: %s" (string-trim-right (buffer-string))))))))))
